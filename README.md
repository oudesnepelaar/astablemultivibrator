# Astable Multivibrator

A PCB design for this classic circuit.
Made purely because I'm too lazy to solder it on a perf-board :-)

I spent  a lot of time selecting the proper SMD components, in order to select the JLCPCB SMT Assembly service.
There were many avialable LCSC components in the EasyEDA library, without it always being clear what the differences were.
Later on, during the ordering process on JLCPCB.com it would become apparent that certain component were out of stock after all.
So I had to adapt the circuit and PCB design several times to get everything neatly together.

I think this is now complete and the ordering of my first set of 5 was completed succesfully.
There is however a possibilty that the availability of certain components may in the near future be reduced to levels requiring a redesign.

I'm especially happy with finding the SMD version of the PH-JST connector socket because I've got a stock of 150+ connectors and
this enables me to make quick wire-to-board connections without having to solder anything at all on the PCBs.
These horizontal and vertical JST sockets are SMT Assembly compatible and can be placed by JLCPCB automatically.

C47647 - horizontal style PH-JST SMD connector
C64658  - vertical style PH-JST SMD connector

The BOURNS 10K and 100K variable resistors as SMD (C780220 & C51284) were hard to find too. There are a variety of similar components in the library,
but these seem to have run of stock in many cases.
